"""Fail the build when production code declares something no screen can reach.

This exists because the same defect kept recurring. Six times in this project a layer looked
finished — written, sensibly named, sometimes with tests — and no screen ever called it: the session
log, the spotlight, the talk-track editor, the follow-up list, a page-geometry helper, and
`DocumentRepository.delete`. Each was found by hand, late, and only because someone went looking.

"It's built" and "it's reachable" are different claims, and building bottom-up makes the second one
easy to assume. A person auditing for this once catches one. Doing it on every build catches all of
them, which is the difference between a habit and a guarantee.

The check is deliberately blunt: every function declared under the main source set must be
referenced somewhere other than its own declaration, unless it is an entry point the framework calls
for us. Blunt is the point — a clever version that inferred call graphs would have its own blind
spots, and this one is easy to reason about when it fires.

Run directly, or via `gradle checkReachable`.
